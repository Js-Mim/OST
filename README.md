Optimal Spectral Transportation : audio musical unmixing using optimal transport.


This repository contains a Python implementation of Optimal Spectral Transportation, a method proposed in the following NIPS 2016 paper:

R. Flamary, C. Févotte, N. Courty, V. Emyia, "Optimal spectral transportation with application to music transcription", Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2016.

It also contains a real time demonstration of the proposed method.


## Installation and dependencies

This repository contains only the ost.py Python module and a demo script.
